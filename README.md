# Excercise - Debugging 1
### Winter 2017 - Android

### Overview:
Learn how to use the debugger to fix a bug in this simple app.

### Getting Started:

1. Clone repository.
2. Create a new branch off master and name the branch according to the form {name}/debugging1 (e.g. mgroves/debugging1).

### Your Task:

1. Run the app and press the "Click Here" button.
2. See the message that appears (and disappears after 5 seconds).
3. Experiment with clicking the button and dismissing the message multiple times at varying intervals.  Try to get the app into a state where the message stays up for fewer than 5 seconds.
4. Once you have observed the problem, use the debugger to find the source of this bug, and then implement a fix.
5. Create a pull request against master with your solution.
